mappingSourceHelpText=You must choose a mapping source (a sequence or an alignment) where the nucleotide positions (column positions) correspond exactly to the data value positions. This allows the data values to be automatically mapped against the structure.
transformHelpText=Selecting a transform can better distribute your data (see the histogram alongside color bar) so that the majority of the data values do not fall within a narrow colour gradient range.\\n\\nNote: setting the minimum and maximum values (above) will affect how the data are transformed.
rangeHelpText=Values out of the specified [minimum, maximum] range can either be treated as missing values (are not drawn on the secondary structure) or as clamped (drawn on the secondary structure, but have their color value displayed as the color value of either the minimum value or the maximum value).
positionHelpText=Checking 'Positions are codon position' transforms the codon position values 1,2,3,... to nucleotide positions 1,4,7,...
matrixHelpText=If the matrix is symmetrical (A<sub>ij</sub>=A<sub>ji</sub>) you may choose to display only one triangle of the matrix, this prevents the same interaction from being rendered twice on the secondary structure.
